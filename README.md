## ðŸ”§ Installation

Install via the Arduino Library Manager or PlatformIO plugin:

[![arduino-library-badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Arduino%20Libraries&message=GovoroxSSLClient&color=orange&logo=arduino)](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/govorox-ssl-client "Go to Arduino Libraries")

**Arduino IDE** - search for "SSLClient"

[![PlatformIO Registry](https://badges.registry.platformio.org/packages/digitaldragon/library/SSLClient.svg)](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/digitaldragon/SSLClient "Go to PlatformIO Registry")

**VSCode / PlatformIO** - add `digitaldragon/SSLClient@^1.3.0` to `platformio.ini`

## ðŸš€ Overview

Originally based on the `WiFiClientSecure` for Arduino-ESP32 the SSLClient extends the ESP32/Arduino ecosystem to secure communication via TLS, providing a transparent SSL/TLS layer over any `Client` class instance. Leverages *mbedtls* for robust, efficient cryptographic operations, initially tailored for ESP32 but adaptable across platforms.

## ðŸŒŸ What's New in the Latest Release

**Major Versions 2 and 3 of MBedTLS**: Updated to support the latest version of the MBedTLS library.  

**ALPN Support**: Application Layer Protocol Negotiation for efficient server communication.  

**Cert Bundles**: Simplifies management and use of multiple CA certificates.  

**Bug Fix**: Corrects byte calculation for record expansion post-handshake.

**More Examples**: Examples for the ESP32 PlatformIO for ALPN protocols, AWS, and using certificate bundles.

## âœ¨ Features

- Secure TLS communication.
- Based on **Mbed-TLS/mbedtls**.
  - **Mbed TLS 2.x**
    TLS Versions Supported: **Mbed TLS 2.x** supports `TLS 1.0`, `TLS 1.1`, and `TLS 1.2`.
    **Specifics:**
    `TLS 1.2`: Full support with a wide range of cipher suites and features.
    `TLS 1.1` and `1.0`: These versions are supported, but their use is discouraged due to security vulnerabilities and weaknesses compared to `TLS 1.2`.
  - **Mbed TLS 3.x**
    TLS Versions Supported: **Mbed TLS 3.x** supports `TLS 1.2` and `TLS 1.3`.
    **Specifics:**
    `TLS 1.2`: Continues full support with extensive cipher suites and features.
    `TLS 1.3`: Introduced in Mbed `TLS 3.x`, providing enhanced security features, improved performance, and simplified handshake process.
- Compatible with Arduino-ESP32 and potentially other platforms.
- Suitable for IoT applications, including AWS IoT.

## ðŸ›  Usage

### Basic Connection

```cpp
#include <SSLClient.h>

// Initialize your transport layer (e.g., WiFi, GSM)
// A Client is anything which inherits from the Arduino Client class.
Client transport = /* Your transport layer */;

// Create SSLClient instance
SSLClient sslClient(&transport);

// Your setup code here...
```

### AWS IoT Connectivity

```cpp
TinyGsmClient transport(modem);
SSLClient secure(&transport);

// Set up certificates
secure.setCACert(AWS_CERT_CA);
secure.setCertificate(AWS_CERT_CRT);
secure.setPrivateKey(AWS_CERT_PRIVATE);

// Connect to MQTT broker on AWS endpoint
MQTTClient mqtt = MQTTClient(256);
mqtt.begin(AWS_IOT_ENDPOINT, 8883, secure);
```
